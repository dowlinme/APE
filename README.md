# APE
 Automated Post-Editing module intended for use on Irish MT output
 Authors: Meghan Dowling and Lauren Cassidy


 Series of replace rules which aim to correct Irish MT output
 Divided into two scripts:

 orth.py - orthography rules, mainly concerning prepositions
 dative.py - initial mutation rules, mainly concerning the dative case

 orth.py must be executed before dative.py as some rules in orth.py may trigger rules in dative.py
